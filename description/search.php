        //### About the Search API
        //
        //The Search API is optimized to help you find the specific item you're looking
        //for (e.g., a specific user, a specific file in a repository, etc.). Think of it
        //the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you
        //find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking
        //for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of
        //search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To
        //satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides **up to 1,000 results for each
        //search**.
        //
        //### Ranking search results
        //
        //Unless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted
        //by best match, as indicated by the `score` field for each item returned. This
        //is a computed value representing the relevance of a item relative to the other
        //items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most
        //relevant item to the top of the result list.
        //
        //### Rate limit
        //
        //The Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using [Basic
        //Authentication](/v3/#authentication), [OAuth](/v3/#authentication), or [client
        //ID and secret](/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications), you can make up to
        //20 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you
        //to make up to 5 requests per minute.
        //
        //See the [rate limit documentation](/v3/#rate-limiting) for details on
        //determining your current rate limit status.
        //
        //### Timeouts and incomplete results
        //
        //To keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query
        //can run. For queries that [exceed the time limit](/changes/2014-04-07-understanding-search-results-and-potential-timeouts/),
        //the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and
        //the response has the `incomplete_results` property set to `true`.
        //
        //Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete.
        //More results might have been found, but also might not.

        //
        //Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
        //
        //<ul>
        //<li>Only the <em>default branch</em> is considered. In most cases, this will be the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
        //<li>Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.</li>
        //<li class='not-enterprise'> You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=✓&q=language%3Ago&type=Code"><code>language:go</code></a> is not valid, while <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=✓&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code"><code>amazing language:go</code></a> is.</li>
        //</ul>

        //API consumers have access to that information as well. Requests can opt to
        //receive those text fragments in the response, and every fragment is accompanied
        //by numeric offsets identifying the exact location of each matching search term.
        //
        //To get this metadata in your search results, specify the `text-match` media type
        //in your Accept header.
        //
        //    application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json
        //
        //The results will provide the same JSON payloads as shown above, with an extra
        //key called `text_matches`. Inside the `text_matches` array, each object includes
        //the following attributes:
        //
        //
        //Name | Description
        //-----|-----------|
        //`object_url` | The URL for the resource that contains a string property matching one of the search terms.
        //`object_type` | The name for the type of resource that exists at the given `object_url`.
        //`property` | The name of a property of the resource that exists at `object_url`. That property is a string that matches one of the search terms. (In the JSON returned from `object_url`, the full content for the `fragment` will be found in the property with this name.)
        //`fragment` | A subset of the value of `property`. This is the text fragment that matches one or more of the search terms.
        //`matches` | An array of one or more search terms that are present in `fragment`. The indices (i.e., "offsets") are relative to the fragment. (They are not relative to the _full_ content of `property`.)
        //
        //### Example
        //
        //Using curl, and the [example issue search](#issue-search-example) above, our API
        //request would look like this:
        //
        //    curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json' \
        //      'https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc'
        //
        //The response will include a `text_matches` array for each search result. In the
        //JSON below, we have two objects in the `text_matches` array.
        //
        //The first text match occurred in the `body` property of the issue. We see a
        //fragment of text from the issue body. The search term (`windows`) appears twice
        //within that fragment, and we have the indices for each occurrence.
        //
        //The second text match occurred in the `body` property of one of the issue's
        //comments. We have the URL for the issue comment. And of course, we see a
        //fragment of text from the comment body. The search term (`windows`) appears once
        //within that fragment.
        //
