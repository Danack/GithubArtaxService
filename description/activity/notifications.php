        //Users receive notifications for conversations in repositories they watch
        //including:
        //
        //* Issues and their comments
        //* Pull Requests and their comments
        //* Comments on any commits
        //
        //Notifications are also sent for conversations in unwatched repositories when the
        //user is involved including:
        //
        //* **@mentions**
        //* Issue assignments
        //* Commits the user authors or commits
        //* Any discussion in which the user actively participates
        //
        //All Notification API calls require the `notifications` or
        //`repo` API scopes.  Doing this will give read-only access to
        //some Issue/Commit content. You will still need the "repo" scope to access
        //Issues and Commits from their respective endpoints.
        //
        //Notifications come back as "threads".  A Thread contains information about the
        //current discussion of an Issue/PullRequest/Commit.
        //
        //Notifications are optimized for polling with the "Last-Modified" header.  If
        //there are no new notifications, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response,
        //leaving your current rate limit untouched.  There is an "X-Poll-Interval"
        //header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times
        //of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.
        //

        //## Notification Reasons
        //
        //When retrieving responses from the Notifications API, each payload has a key titled
        //`reason`. These correspond to events that trigger a notification.
        //
        //Here's a list of potential `reason`s for receiving a notification:
        //
        //Reason Name | Description
        //------------|------------
        //`subscribed` | The notification arrived because you're watching the repository
        //`manual` | The notification arrived because you've specifically decided to subscribe to the thread (via an Issue or Pull Request)
        //`author` | The notification arrived because you've created the thread
        //`comment` | The notification arrived because you've commented on the thread
        //`mention` | The notification arrived because you were specifically **@mentioned** in the content
        //`team_mention` | The notification arrived because you were on a team that was mentioned (like @org/team)
        //`state_change` | The notification arrived because you changed the thread state (like closing an Issue or merging a Pull Request)
        //`assign` | The notification arrived because you were assigned to the Issue
        //
        //Note that the `reason` is modified on a per-thread basis, and can change, if the
        //`reason` on a later notification is different.
        //
        //For example, if you are the author of an issue, subsequent notifications on that
        //issue will have a `reason` of `author`. If you're then  **@mentioned** on the same
        //issue, the notifications you fetch thereafter will have a `reason` of `mention`.
        //The `reason` remains as `mention`, regardless of whether you're ever mentioned again.
        //
        //## List your notifications
        //
        //List all notifications for the current user, grouped by repository.
