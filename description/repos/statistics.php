//types of repository activity.

//### A word about caching
//
//Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached
//data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's
//statistics, you'll receive a `202` response; a background job is also fired to
//start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and
//then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a
//`200` response with the statistics in the response body.
//
//Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch,
//which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.
