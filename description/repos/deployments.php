//
//Deployments are a request for a specific ref(branch,sha,tag) to be deployed.
//GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for
//and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled
//tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation
//details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).
//
//Deployment Statuses allow external services to mark deployments with a
//'success', 'failure', 'error', or 'pending' state, which can then be consumed
//by any system listening for `deployment_status` events.
//
//Deployment Statuses can also include an optional `description` and `target_url`, and
//we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more
//useful. The `target_url` would be the full URL to the deployment output, and
//the `description` would be the high level summary of what happened with the
//deployment.
//
//Deployments and Deployment Statuses both have associated
//[repository events](/v3/activity/events/types/#deploymentevent) when
//they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to
//deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is
//made.
//
//Below is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.

//Keep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to
//your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events.  This allows for
//[github-services](https://github.com/github/github-services) integrations as
//well as running your own systems depending on your use case.  Multiple systems
//can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to
//decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your
//servers, building native code, etc.
//
//Note that the `repo_deployment` [OAuth scope](/v3/oauth/#scopes) grants
//targeted access to Deployments and Deployment Statuses **without**
//granting access to repository code, while the `repo` scope grants permission to code
//as well.

        //## Create a Deployment
        //
        //Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with sane defaults.
        //
        //The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or sha. At GitHub we often
        //deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request.
        //
        //The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different
        //runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying
        //their applications, like 'production', 'staging', and 'qa'. This allows for
        //easy tracking of which environments had deployments requested. The default
        //environment is 'production'.
        //
        //The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not
        //behind the repository's default branch. If the ref *is* behind the default
        //branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge
        //succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts
        //prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response.
        //
        //By default, [commit statuses](/v3/repos/statuses) for every submitted context
        //must be in a 'success' state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to
        //specify a subset of contexts that must be "success", or to specify contexts
        //that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses
        //to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses,
        //the deployment will always succeed.
        //
        //The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a
        //deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on
        //when a deployment event is dispatched.
        //
        //The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different
        //execution paths. In the web world this might be 'deploy:migrations' to run
        //schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to
        //compile an application with debugging enabled.
        //
        //Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref:
        //
        //    POST /repos/:owner/:repo/deployments

        //### Parameters
        //
        //Name | Type | Description
        //-----|------|--------------
        //`ref`|`string`| **Required**. The ref to deploy. This can be a branch, tag, or sha.
        //`task`|`string`| Optional parameter to specify a task to execute, e.g. `deploy` or `deploy:migrations`. Default: `deploy`
        //`auto_merge`|`boolean`| Optional parameter to merge the default branch into the requested ref if it is behind the default branch. Default: `true`
        //`required_contexts`|`Array`| Optional array of status contexts verified against commit status checks. If this parameter is omitted from the parameters then all unique contexts will be verified before a deployment is created. To bypass checking entirely pass an empty array. Defaults to all unique contexts.
        //`payload`|`string` | Optional JSON payload with extra information about the deployment. Default: `""`
        //`environment`|`string` | Optional name for the target deployment environment (e.g., production, staging, qa). Default: `"production"`
        //`description`|`string` | Optional short description. Default: `""`
        //
        //#### Simple Example
        //

        //chat networks.
