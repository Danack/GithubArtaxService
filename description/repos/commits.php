    //    GET 
    //
    //### Response
    //
    //The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in reverse chronological order.
    //
    //== json :commit_comparison 
    //
    //Pass the appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.

    //### Working with large comparisons
    //
    //The response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [Commit List API](/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository) to enumerate all commits in the range.
    //
    //For comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long to generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.
