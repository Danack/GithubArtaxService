    //The Repo Commits API supports listing, viewing, and comparing commits in a repository.

    //## List commits on a repository
    //
    //    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/commits
    //
    //### Parameters
    //
    //Name | Type | Description
    //-----|------|--------------
    //`sha`|`string` | SHA or branch to start listing commits from. Default: the repositoryâ€™s default branch (usually `master`).
    //`path`|`string` | Only commits containing this file path will be returned.
    //`author`|`string` | GitHub login or email address by which to filter by commit author.
    //`since`|`string` | Only commits after this date will be returned. This is a timestamp in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
    //`until`|`string` | Only commits before this date will be returned. This is a timestamp in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

    //### Response
    //
    //==
    //  headers 200, :pagination => { :next => 'https://api.github.com/resource?page=2' }

    //== headers 200 
    //== json(:full_commit) 
    //
    //Note: Diffs with binary data will have no 'patch' property. Pass the
    //appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and
    //patch formats.

    //
    //    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/compare/:base...:head
    //
    //Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`. For example:
    //
    //    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/compare/hubot:branchname...octocat:branchname
    //
    //### Response
    //
    //The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in reverse chronological order.
    //
    //== json :commit_comparison 
    //
    //Pass the appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
    
    //### Working with large comparisons
    //
    //The response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [Commit List API](/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository) to enumerate all commits in the range.
    //
    //For comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long to generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.
