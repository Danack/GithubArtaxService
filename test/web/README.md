This a trivial example of a web site that interacts with Github, to allow for interactive testing of the Oauth2 permissions generation - aka going to Github in a browser and giving the test app permission to retrieve info on your behalf.


From the command line, go to the test directory and run `php -S localhost:8000 -t web/`


The web server should now be available at http://localhost:8000/
